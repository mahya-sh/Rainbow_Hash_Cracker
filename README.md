# Rainbow_Hash_Cracker
Rainbow Hash Cracker is a project that involves cracking password hashes using the Rainbow table method. Given a CSV file with usernames and password hashes, the program utilizes the SHA256 algorithm to compare hashed passwords with a range of 4-digit numbers (0-9999). When a match is found, the corresponding number is considered the cracked password.
